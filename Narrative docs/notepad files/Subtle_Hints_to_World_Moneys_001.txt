"Goodday sir Maddock"
>"Good afternoon Beladi"
"I've just reached the terminals and I'm waiting to board the plane"
>"Very well Beladi, we must take this chance we must attend this meeting"
"Indeed sir, if we can buy the land from the locals we can get the drilling operation up and running within weeks"
>"If we succeed we'll make millions off this property alone"
"Also we shouldn't forget about the legal parts of this contract, we cannot let this reach the public"
>"Don't you worry about that Beladi, there will be no loose ends on the ground nor will anyone talk"
"I don't worry about that sir, this bloody plane should hurry up if we want to make it on time"
>"Next time we'll own a private jet for these trips Beladi, but for now focus on your task at hand"
"Not to worry sir, these filthy Westerners are nothing compared to me"
>"Make haste Beladi! Time is money!"
"Yes sir!"
>"Save journey Beladi"
"Thank you sir"
