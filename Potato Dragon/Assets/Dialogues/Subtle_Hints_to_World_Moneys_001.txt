"Goodday, sir Maddock."
>"Good afternoon, Beladi."
"I've just reached the terminals and I'm waiting to board the plane."
>"Very well, Beladi. We must take this chance. We must attend this meeting."
"Indeed, sir. If we can buy the land from the locals, we can get the drilling operation up and running within weeks."
>"If we succeed, we'll make millions off this property alone."
"Also, we shouldn't forget about the legal parts of this contract. We cannot let this reach the public."
>"Don't you worry about that, Beladi. There will be no loose ends on the ground, nor will anyone talk."
"I don't worry about that, sir. This bloody plane should hurry up, if we want to make it on time."
>"Next time we'll own a private jet for these trips, Beladi. For now, just focus on the task at hand."
"Not to worry sir, these filthy Westerners are nothing compared to me."
>"Make haste, Beladi! Time is money!"
"Yes sir!"
>"Save journey, Beladi."
"Thank you, sir."
