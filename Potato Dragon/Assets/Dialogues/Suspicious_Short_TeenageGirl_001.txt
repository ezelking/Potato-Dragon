"Hey, Helen."
>"Hola, Astrid. Something wrong?"
"There's this weird guy looking at me."
>"What a creep!"
"Luckily I'm not alone, but he's making me uncomfortable."
>"Stay away from that creep, Astrid!"
"Yeah. The weirdest thing is: he's looking at everyone like a creep."
>"What a fucking weirdo!"
"He's definitely hiding something."
>"Maybe he's scared of flying."
"Hahaha yeah probably, that would make sense."
>"I gotta go Astrid. You stay away from that creep okay?!"
"Okay, Helen. Thank you and I will."
>"Bye."
"Bye."
