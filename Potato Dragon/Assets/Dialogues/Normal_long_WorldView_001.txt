>"Hello Lex, this is Lena speaking."
"Oh hello Lena, how are you doing?"
>"I am doing good, how are you?"
"Great great, can I do something for you?"
>"Last week your report stated no one died at the site, but locals report dozens are hospitalized."
"People die every day, Lena. These people did not die because of our work."
>"Nine people died with signs of poison, the same poison found on the site."
"The substance is found everywhere in the region, there is no evidence Lena."
>"Those people worked at the site, Lex. Those who survive, say the site is haunted."
"Backwards and superstitious people, that's all."
>"How can you say that?! these people die for your interests!"
"We are giving these people jobs, Lena. The region wealth is increasing because of us."
>"You know I am publicating this, do you?"
"Do what you wish Lena. I stand by my report and the company does the same."
>"The same company that has been proven to disregard human rights all over the globe."
"None of those cases have been proven."
>"Yet international court sanctioned the company."
"Public opinion, Lena."
>"...and fact."
"Good day, Lena."
